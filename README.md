Battle Pet Tabs
==================
You can create up to eight team loadouts and toggle between them by pressing the tabs on the Pet Journal - could it get any simpler? You can also store various team compositions into snapshots and then easily swap between entire team loadouts at once!

Quick start
------------------
- Right-click a tab to delete.
- Right-click a tab while holding down alt/shift/ctrl to rename.
- Click "+" to create a new team. (Current team is copied as a starting point.)
- Click a tab to load the assigned team.
- Drag a tab to create a macro. You can place it on your bar for quick access. (Note that you can right-click the macro to quickly open the Pet Journal.)
